## General Information

- This project focuses on analyzing bike-sharing data, particularly looking at demand trends and factors influencing the number of bike rentals.
- The background of this project stems from the need to optimize bike-sharing systems by better understanding usage patterns.
- The business problem it aims to solve is how to predict bike rental demand, which can help in better distribution and availability of bikes in bike-sharing services.
- The dataset includes features such as date, weather conditions, and the number of registered and casual users, with the target variable being the total bike rentals (cnt), which is the sum of registered and casual users.

## Conclusions

- The rental demand is highly influenced by weather conditions, with temperature being a significant factor.
- There is a clear trend in the increase of bike rentals over time, likely due to growing awareness and accessibility.
- Predictive models like linear regression have been applied to forecast bike rental demand with reasonable accuracy, though further improvements could be made with more complex models.
